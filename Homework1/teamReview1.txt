The vision statement for team DragonsBreath is well thought out and fleshed out well.
One question I have for the team after reading the vision statement is do you plan
to incorporate your app with Calvin's quest orientation? Or is the hope for this app
to be its own separate entity? The idea that you have is interesting and I think it
could be a fun event for freshmen to do with their friends/floor.

Team DragonsBreath does have some prototype code, but it's not much of a prototype. There's 
not much to base their application on. It looks like they haven't spent much time on making
a prototype of their app yet.
